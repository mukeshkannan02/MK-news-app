# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# News-App  

## Overview  
**News-App** is a React application powered by Vite that displays real-time news updates across categories like General, Entertainment, Science, Business, Sports, Health, and Technology. The app uses the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) to fetch live news and automatically refreshes content every 15-30 minutes.  

This project is designed to run locally on `localhost` due to API restrictions that prevent public deployment without a paid subscription.  

## Features  
- **Live News Updates**: Fetches the latest news in real-time.  
- **Category-based Browsing**: Users can view news by category.  
- **Breaking News Section**: Highlights trending and important news.  
- **Auto-Refresh**: News updates automatically every 15-30 minutes.  
- **Optimized Performance**: Built using Vite for fast builds and development.  

## Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:  
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)  
- npm or yarn  
- A valid **News API Key** from [News API](https://newsapi.org/).  

## Installation  
1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/mukeshkannan02/MK-news-app.git
